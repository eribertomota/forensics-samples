NAME
  fsdeploy - deploy a disk image from forensics-samples

SYNOPSIS
  fsdeploy <file.xz>

DESCRIPTION
  fsdeploy is a command to provide a disk image from forensics-samples package
  to a CI test environment in Debian.

  fsdeploy will copy file.xz to $AUTOPKGTEST_TMP and unzip it, making the
  selected file available for CI tests via autopkgtest command.

  On Debian systems, forensics-samples-<filesystem> packages will depend of the
  forensics-samples-tools, that provides fsdeploy command.

OPTIONS
  Possible values are: fs.btrfs.xz, fs.exfat.xz, fs.ext2.xz, fs.ext4.xz,
  fs.ntfs.xz and fs.vfat.xz.

EXAMPLE
  See below an example of use from a debian/tests/control file:

    Test-Command: fsdeploy fs.ntfs.xz;
                  cd $AUTOPKGTEST_TMP;
                  foremost -Tq fs.ntfs.xz;
                  tree -C output-*
    Depends: @, forensics-samples-ntfs, tree
    Restrictions: allow-stderr

  Now an example for mac-robber:

    Test-Command: ls /dev/loop0 > /dev/null || exit 77;
                  fsdeploy fs.btrfs.xz;
                  cd $AUTOPKGTEST_TMP;
                  mkdir mnt;
                  mount -o ro,offset=1048576 fs.btrfs mnt;
                  mac-robber mnt;
                  umount mnt
    Depends: @, forensics-samples-btrfs
