NAME
  fsdeploy - deploy a disk image from forensics-samples

SYNOPSIS
  fsdeploy <file.xz>

DESCRIPTION
  fsdeploy is a command to provide a disk image from forensics-samples package
  to a CI test environment in Debian. It also can provide the original-files
  directory from forensics-samples.

  fsdeploy will copy file.xz to $AUTOPKGTEST_TMP and unzip it, making the
  selected file available for CI tests via autopkgtest command. It also can
  copy original-files to $AUTOPKGTEST_TMP (no unzip needed).

  On Debian systems, forensics-samples-<filesystem> and forensics-samples-files
  packages will depend of the forensics-samples-tools, that provides fsdeploy
  command.

OPTIONS
  Possible values are: fs.btrfs.xz, fs.exfat.xz, fs.ext2.xz, fs.ext4.xz,
  fs.ntfs.xz, fs.vfat.xz, fs.multiple.xz and original-files.

  fs.multiple.xz has some filesystems.

EXAMPLES
  See below an example of a possible debian/tests/control file for foremost:

    Test-Command: fsdeploy fs.ntfs.xz;
                  cd $AUTOPKGTEST_TMP;
                  foremost -Tq fs.ntfs.xz;
                  tree -C output-*
    Depends: @, forensics-samples-ntfs, tree
    Restrictions: allow-stderr


  Now an example for mac-robber:

    Test-Command: fsdeploy original-files;
                  mac-robber $AUTOPKGTEST_TMP | grep a-text
    Depends: @, forensics-samples-files
    
    Test-Command: [ -e /dev/loop0 ] || exit 77;
                  fsdeploy fs.ext4.xz;
                  cd $AUTOPKGTEST_TMP;
                  mkdir mnt;
                  mount -o ro,offset=1048576 fs.ext4 mnt;
                  mac-robber mnt | grep a-text;
                  umount mnt
    Depends: @, forensics-samples-ext4
    # isolation-machine will provide access to /dev/loop0, essential to mount
    # images using the mount command.
    # rw-build-tree allow autopkgtest run several times.
    Restrictions: allow-stderr, isolation-machine, needs-root, rw-build-tree, skippable

  Note that Debian CI environments commonly are not able to run
  isolation-machine. Consequently, the test will be skipped.

  Example for disktype command:

    Test-Command: fsdeploy fs.multiple.xz;
                  cd $AUTOPKGTEST_TMP;
                  disktype fs.multiple
    Depends: @, forensics-samples-multiple
